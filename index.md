Favorite CPSC 120L labs
Lab 4, part 2  

  * This lab was fun because it was the first time that I got to use to nested if statements. They were used to make a guessing game. 
This proved to be a learning curve because now I was beginning to be flexible with the information I had learned.                                                                                                                  

Lab 6 

  * This was a stimulating lab where I got to apply coding to a game I had played before, blackjack. Though this time I set the game by using Boolean functions and using conditional operations. This lab taught me to think creatively about every code written.   

Lab 8 

  * This was my favorite lab, and it also felt like the most challenging. It was a time when I used vectors, worked with size of an array, and used nest for loops. In a lot of ways, it made me greatful for the opportunity to get hands on practice for coding.
